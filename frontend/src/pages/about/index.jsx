        <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
        <p>As a teacher and web developer, I thrive in two realms: imparting knowledge in classrooms and crafting digital solutions. With a passion for education, I inspire minds to grow, while my coding skills bring ideas to life on the web. Juggling between lesson plans and code blocks, I find joy in both teaching and coding, each complementing the other. Guiding students to understand complex concepts mirrors the process of debugging codeâ€”both require patience and clear communication. Embracing innovation, I integrate technology into education, fostering a dynamic learning environment. Outside the classroom, I dive into web development projects, constantly honing my skills and exploring new technologies. Balancing these dual roles, I find fulfillment in shaping minds and shaping code, leaving a lasting impact in both worlds.
